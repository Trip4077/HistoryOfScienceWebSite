	<p class="scitext"><span id="modpb">Dmitri Ivanovich Mendeleev</span> was a Russian chemist and inventor. He formulated the Periodic Law, created a 
	farsighted version of the periodic table of elements, and used it to correct the properties of some already discovered elements and also to predict the 
	properties of eight elements yet to be discovered. 
	  <br /><br/>
    Mendeleev was born in the village of Verkhnie Aremzyani, near Tobolsk in Siberia, to Ivan Pavlovich Mendeleev (1783–1847) and Maria Dmitrievna Mendeleeva 
	(née Kornilieva) (1793–1850). His paternal grandfather Pavel Maximovich Sokolov was a Russian Orthodox priest from the Tver region. Ivan, along with his 
	brothers and sisters, obtained new family names while attending the theological seminary. He worked as a school principal and a teacher of fine arts, 
	politics and philosophy at the Tambov and Saratov gymnasiums.
	  <br /><br />
	As he began to teach inorganic chemistry, Mendeleev could not find a textbook that met his needs. Since he had already published a textbook on organic 
	chemistry in 1861 that had been awarded the prestigious Demidov Prize, he set out to write another one. The result was Osnovy khimii (1868–71; The 
	Principles of Chemistry), which became a classic, running through many editions and many translations. When Mendeleev began to compose the chapter on the 
	halogen elements (chlorine and its analogs) at the end of the first volume, he compared the properties of this group of elements to those of the group of
	alkali metals such as sodium. Within these two groups of dissimilar elements, he discovered similarities in the progression of atomic weights, and he 
	wondered if other groups of elements exhibited similar properties. After studying the alkaline earths, Mendeleev established that the order of atomic
	weights could be used not only to arrange the elements within each group but also to arrange the groups themselves. Thus, in his effort to make sense of 
	the extensive knowledge that already existed of the chemical and physical properties of the chemical elements and their compounds, Mendeleev discovered the
	periodic law.
