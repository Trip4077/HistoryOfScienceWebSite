	<p class="scitext"><span id="modpb">Carl Linnaeus</span> was a Swedish botanist, physician and zoologist, who formalised the modern system of naming organisms called 
	binomial nomenclature. He is known by the epithet "father of modern taxonomy". Linnaeus was born in the countryside of Småland, in southern Sweden. He 
	received most of his higher education at Uppsala University and began giving lectures in botany there in 1730. He lived abroad between 1735 and 1738, 
	where he studied and also published a first edition of his Systema Naturae in the Netherlands. He then returned to Sweden, where he became professor of 
	medicine and botany at Uppsala. In the 1740s, he was sent on several journeys through Sweden to find and classify plants and animals. 
	  <br /><br/>
    Classification since Linnaeus has incorporated newly discovered information and more closely approaches a natural system. When the life history of
	<span id="modpi">barnacles</span> was discovered, for example, they could no longer be associated with mollusks because it became clear that they were 
	arthropods (jointed-legged animals such as crabs and insects). In 1732 he was awarded funding for an expedition to Lapland, in the far north of Sweden. From
	May to October that year the 25 year-old botany lecturer traveled 1250 miles (2000 km) in Lapland, making observations of the native plants and birds. He
	also made geological notes. On this journey he discovered about 100 new plants. He wrote a book about Lapland’s plants called Flora Lapponica, describing 
	his new discoveries. He also started using a two-part naming system – which would eventually become the Linnaean or binomial system, used worldwide to name
	living things.	
	  <br /><br >
	Although the system, now known as binomial nomenclature, was partially developed by the Bauhin brothers, Gaspard and Johann, 200 years earlier,
	Linnaeus was first to use it consistently throughout his book. The first edition was published in 1735. The full title of the 10th edition (1758), 
	which was the most important one, was Systema naturæ per regna tria naturæ, secundum classes, ordines, genera, species, cum characteribus, differentiis, 
	synonymis, locis or translated: "System of nature through the three kingdoms of nature, according to classes, orders, genera and species, with characters,
	differences, synonyms, places".
	  <br /><br />
	The tenth edition of this book (1758) is considered the starting point of zoological nomenclature. In 1766–1768 Linnaeus published the much enhanced 12th
	edition, the last under his authorship. Another again enhanced work in the same style and entitled "Systema Naturae" was published by Johann Friedrich 
	Gmelin between 1788 and 1793. Since at least the early 1900s zoologists commonly recognized this as the last edition belonging to this series. It was also
	officially regarded by the ICZN in Opinion 296 (26 Oct 1954) as the 13th edition of Systema Naturae.
	  <br /><br />
	At the age of sixty his memory began to fail; an apoplectic attack in 1774 greatly weakened him; two years after he lost the use of his right side; and 
	he died on the 10th of January 1778 at Uppsala, in the cathedral of which he was buried. Linnaeaus had one spouse, Sara Elisabeth Moraea, and a total of 
	seven children to carry on his legacy. He helped shaped the world of Biology that we know today. While there, he became one of the founders of the Royal
	Swedish Academy of Sciences and became its first Praeses when his name was drawn. He was rewarded for his contributions to science with ennoblement by 
	the Swedish king, taking the name Carl von Linne'.
