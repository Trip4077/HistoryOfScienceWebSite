	<p class="scitext"><span id="modpb">Abu Mūsā Jābir ibn Hayyān</span> was a polymath: a chemist and alchemist, astronomer and astrologer, engineer, 
	geographer, philosopher, physicist, and pharmacist and physician. Born and educated in Tus, he later traveled to Kufa. He has been described as the 
	father of early chemistry.
	  <br /><br/>
    Jabir was a natural philosopher who lived mostly in the 8th century; he was born in Tus, Khorasan, in Persia, well known as Iran then ruled by the 
	Umayyad Caliphate. Jabir in the classical sources has been variously attributed as al-Azdi al-Barigi or al-Kufi or al-Tusi or al-Sufi. There is a
	difference of opinion as to whether he was a Persian from Khorasan who later went to Kufa or whether he was, as some have suggested, of Syrian origin and 
	later lived in Persia and Iraq. His ethnic background is not clear, but most sources reference him as a Persian. In some sources, he is reported to 
	have been the son of Hayyan al-Azdi, a pharmacist of the Arabian Azd tribe who emigrated from Yemen to Kufa (in present-day Iraq) during the 
	Umayyad Caliphate. While Henry Corbin believes Geber seems to have been a non-Arab client of the 'Azd tribe. Hayyan had supported the Abbasid revolt 
	against the Umayyads, and was sent by them to the province of Khorasan to gather support for their cause. He was eventually caught by the Umayyads 
	and executed. His family fled to Yemen, where Jabir grew up and studied the Quran, mathematics and other subjects. Jabir's father's profession 
	may have contributed greatly to his interest in alchemy.
	  <br /><br />
	Perhaps the most original aspect of the Jabirian corpus is a type of arithmology (numerology) referred to as the “method of the balance” (mīzān). In 
	essence, this consisted of determining the quantity of the “four natures” (hot, cold, wet, and dry) in a substance by means of its name. Each letter of the
	Arabic alphabet was given a numerical value, and depending on the order of the letters, they were applied to the different “natures.” The Jabirian texts 
	also argue that all things contain a “hidden” (bāṭin) reality as well as the “manifest” (zāhir) one arrived at in the way described. The hidden natures 
	were thought to fall into the proportionality 1:3:5:8, which always added up to 17 or a multiple of 17.
	  <br /><br />
	The Summa contains the first clear statement of the “mercury alone” theory, according to which quicksilver (mercury) is the “pure substance” of the metals,
	and sulfur is primarily a corruptor. In an attempt to imitate the operations of nature itself, Geber advised other alchemists to rely on quicksilver and 
	its compounds for transmutational agents and to eschew organic materials such as blood, hair, and eggs.
	  <br /><br />
	A second innovation of the Summa lies in its groundbreaking theory of three orders of medicines. According to this theory, which owes something to vague 
	comments found in Jābir’s Liber de septuaginta, transmutative agents occur in a threefold order of increasing effectiveness. A medicine of the first or
	second order leads to superficial and temporary change in the base metals, whereas a medicine of the third order produces genuine and permanent silver or
	gold. The Summa gives a corpuscular explanation to the varied perfection of the medicines, arguing that a medicine’s perfection increases as the corpuscles
	from which it is made decrease in size. This corpuscular theory of matter is used by Geber to explain a host of processes, including sublimation, 
	distillation, calcination, cupellation, cementation, and the production of minerals within mines. Geber’s corpuscular theory was to have a major impact in 
	the history of science: it was influential even in the 17th century, when it conditioned the corpuscular philosophy of the German physician Daniel Sennert,
	English scientist Kenelm Digby, British natural philosopher Robert Boyle, and others.
