	<p class="scitext"><span id="modpb">Sir Isaac Newton</span> was an English mathematician, astronomer, theologian, author and physicist (described in his 
	own day as a "natural philosopher") who is widely recognised as one of the most influential scientists of all time, and a key figure in the scientific 
	revolution. His book Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica ("Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy"), first published in 1687, laid the 
	foundations of classical mechanics. Newton also made pathbreaking contributions to optics, and he shares credit with Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz for 
	developing the infinitesimal calculus.
	  <br /><br/>
    Newton's Principia formulated the laws of motion and universal gravitation that dominated scientists' view of the physical universe for the next three
	centuries. By deriving Kepler's laws of planetary motion from his mathematical description of gravity, and using the same principles to account for the 
	trajectories of comets, the tides, the precession of the equinoxes, and other phenomena, Newton removed the last doubts about the validity of the 
	heliocentric model of the Solar System and demonstrated that the motion of objects on Earth and of celestial bodies could be accounted for by the same
	principles. Newton's theoretical prediction that the Earth is shaped as an oblate spheroid was later vindicated by the geodetic measurements of Maupertuis,
	La Condamine, and others, thus convincing most Continental European scientists of the superiority of Newtonian mechanics over the earlier system of 
	Descartes.
	  <br /><br />
	Newton also built the first practical reflecting telescope and developed a sophisticated theory of colour based on the observation that a prism decomposes 
	white light into the colours of the visible spectrum. Newton's work on light was collected in his highly influential book Opticks, first published in 1704.
	He also formulated an empirical law of cooling, made the first theoretical calculation of the speed of sound, and introduced the notion of a Newtonian 
	fluid. In addition to his work on calculus, as a mathematician Newton contributed to the study of power series, generalised the binomial theorem to 
	non-integer exponents, developed a method for approximating the roots of a function, and classified most of the cubic plane curves.
	  <br /><br />
	Between 1665 and 1667, Newton returned home from Trinity College to pursue his private study, as school was closed due to the Great Plague. Legend has it 
	that, at this time, Newton experienced his famous inspiration of gravity with the falling apple. According to this common myth, Newton was sitting under 
	an apple tree when a fruit fell and hit him on the head, inspiring him to suddenly come up with the theory of gravity. While there is no evidence that the 
	apple actually hit Newton on the head, he did see an apple fall from a tree, leading him to wonder why it fell straight down and not at an angle.
	Consequently, he began exploring the theories of motion and gravity.
    It was during this 18-month hiatus as a student that Newton conceived many of his most important insights—including the method of infinitesimal calculus,
	the foundations for his theory of light and color, and the laws of planetary motion—that eventually led to the publication of his physics book Principia 
	and his theory of gravity.
