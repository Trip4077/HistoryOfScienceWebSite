	<p class="scitext"><span id="modpb">Charles Robert Darwin</span> (February 12, 1809 to April 19, 1882) was a naturalist and biologist known for his theory of evolution and the process of natural 
    selection. Born in Shrewsbury, England, in 1831 he embarked on a five-year survey voyage around the world on the HMS Beagle; his studies of specimens led 
	him to formulate his theories. In 1859, he published On the <i>Origin of Species</i>.
	  <br /><br/>
    Darwin was the second son of society doctor Robert Waring Darwin and of Susannah Wedgwood, daughter of the Unitarian pottery industrialist Josiah Wedgwood.
	Darwin’s other grandfather, Erasmus Darwin, a freethinking physician and poet fashionable before the French Revolution, was author of Zoonomia; or the Laws
	of Organic Life (1794–96). Darwin’s mother died when he was eight, and he was cared for by his three elder sisters. The boy stood in awe of his overbearing
	father, whose astute medical observations taught him much about human psychology.
	  <br /><br >
	Darwin's early interest in nature led him to neglect his medical education at the University of Edinburgh; instead, he helped to investigate marine
	invertebrates. Studies at the University of Cambridge (Christ's College) encouraged his passion for natural science. His five-year voyage on HMS
	Beagle established him as an eminent geologist whose observations and theories supported Charles Lyell's uniformitarian ideas, and publication of his 
	journal of the voyage made him famous as a popular author.
	  <br /><br />
	The book aroused international interest, with less controversy than had greeted the popular Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation. Though Darwin's 
	illness kept him away from the public debates, he eagerly scrutinised the scientific response, commenting on press cuttings, reviews, articles, satires 
	and caricatures, and corresponded on it with colleagues worldwide. The book did not explicitly discuss human origins, but included a number
	of hints about the animal ancestry of humans from which the inference could be made. The first review asked, "If a monkey has become a man–what may 
	not a man become?" and said it should be left to theologians as it was too dangerous for ordinary readers. Amongst early favourable responses, Huxley's 
	reviews swiped at Richard Owen, leader of the scientific establishment Huxley was trying to overthrow. 
	  <br /><br />
	  <br /><br />
	  <br /><br />
	In April, Owen's review attacked Darwin's friends 
	and condescendingly dismissed his ideas, angering Darwin,but Owen and others began to promote ideas of supernaturally guided evolution. Patrick 
	Matthew drew attention to his 1831 book which had a brief appendix suggesting a concept of natural selection leading to new species, but he had not 
	developed the idea.
