	  <p class="maintext">The History of Science webpage aims to take you on a tour through the ages discovering how mankind has developed methodologies for studying different fields of science. This website offers pages dedicated to pioneers in various fields as well as ongoing research. We hope to see this project as an ongoing effort to organize and disaply an adequate collection of entries that will help people to learn about the many great scientists who have come and gone. Select any of the fields listed below to make a selection, or use the navigation bar to the left.
