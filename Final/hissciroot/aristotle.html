	<p class="scitext"><span id="modpb">Aristotle</span>  was an ancient Greek philosopher and scientist born in the city of Stagira, Chalkidiki, in the north
	of Classical Greece. Along with Plato, Aristotle is considered the "Father of Western Philosophy", which inherited almost its entire lexicon from his 
	teachings, including problems and methods of inquiry, so influencing almost all forms of knowledge.
	  <br /><br/>
    Little is known for certain about his life. His father, Nicomachus, died when Aristotle was a child, and he was brought up by a guardian. At seventeen or 
	eighteen years of age, he joined Plato's Academy in Athens and remained there until the age of thirty-seven (c. 347 BC). His writings cover many subjects 
	– including physics, biology, zoology, metaphysics, logic, ethics, aesthetics, poetry, theatre, music, rhetoric, psychology, linguistics, politics and 
	government – and constitute the first comprehensive system of Western philosophy. Shortly after Plato died, Aristotle left Athens and, at the request of 
	Philip II of Macedon, tutored Alexander the Great beginning in 343 BC. Teaching Alexander gave Aristotle many opportunities. He established a library in 
	the Lyceum which helped him to produce many of his hundreds of books, which were papyrus scrolls. The fact that Aristotle was a pupil of Plato contributed
	to his former views of Platonism, but, following Plato's death, Aristotle immersed himself in empirical studies and shifted from Platonism to empiricism.
	He believed all concepts and knowledge were ultimately based on perception. Aristotle's views on natural sciences represent the groundwork underlying many 
	of his works.
	  <br /><br />
	Aristotle's views on physical science profoundly shaped medieval scholarship. Their influence extended from Late Antiquity and the Early Middle Ages into 
	the Renaissance, and were not replaced systematically until the Enlightenment and theories such as classical mechanics. In his <i>On Generation and 
	Corruption</i>, Aristotle related each of the four elements proposed earlier by Empedocles, Earth, Water, Air, and Fire, to two of the four sensible 
	qualities, hot, cold, wet, and dry. In the Empedoclean scheme, all matter was made of the four elements, in differing proportions. Aristotle's scheme 
	added the heavenly Aether, the divine substance of the heavenly spheres, stars and planets.
	<br /><br />
	Aristotle's physics of moving bodies is either overlooked in philosophical accounts or dismissed as "intuitive", grossly erroneous, or not even science.
	For example, it is stated that John Philoponus and Galileo showed by experiment that Aristotle's claim that a heavier object falls faster than a lighter 
	object is incorrect. However, the physicist Carlo Rovelli argues that this is "profoundly misleading", since Aristotle's physics of motion is based on 
	observation, is counterintuitive, and correct within its domain of validity. Aristotle describes "violent (or unnatural) motion", such as that of a thrown 
	stone, in the Physics (254b10), and "natural motion", such as of a falling object, in On the Heavens (300a20). In violent motion, as soon as the agent 
	stops causing it, the motion stops also. Natural motion depends on the element concerned: the aether naturally moves in a circle around the heavens, 
	while the 4 Empedoclean elements move vertically up (like fire, as is observed) or down (like earth) towards their natural resting places.
